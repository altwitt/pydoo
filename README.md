# pydoo--quick and simple

# This list application lets you make task list quickly from the
# command line. 
## Currently, I still need to finish documentation.
## But here are the basic instructions:

### The repo comes with a pre-populated list with the three groups 
### code, work, and home, but you can change those if you want
### The main prompt asks you if you want add, remove, list, or quit. 
### Just type the single characters a, l, r, or q. 
### If you choose add or remove (a or r), the next prompt will ask
### for a group. Type either c for code, w for work, or h for home.
### Then, for:
### add - You type the task in the third prompt
### remove - You type the number of the task you want removed.
### list - Prints out the current list.
### quit - If you want to exit, type q then y for saving, n for not.

# I hope you enjoy and make use of this.

## Best Regards,

## Harrison
