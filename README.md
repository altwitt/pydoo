```
When I would had a flash of an idea (that I would probably forget), I wanted a lightweight 
python app to quickly put something down on my Android. I love it and still use it everyday!   

## How to begin
### NO REQUIREMENTS
#### Until I make this a proper package, the commands are:
```
cd /preferred/path
git clone https://github.com/altwitt/pydoo.git
cd pydoo
python pydoo.py
```
# That's it!

## Once it is running
```
It is 11.15PM on 12.10.2018
================================
Lets write some tasks!


(l)ist, (a)dd, (r)emove, or (q)uit: # Four choices
```
# (l)ist - lists the included tasks saved in pydoo.txt
```
CODING GROUP================================
1: Google API
2: Learn COBOL
3: Write an awesome todo app
WORK GROUP================================
1: TPS Report
2: Visit Shredding stors
3: Not supposed to be here today!!
HOME GROUP================================
1: bathoom
2: Seal up Attic
3: Fix shed


(l)ist, (a)dd, (r)emove, or (q)uit:
```

# (a)dd - adds a task. 
```
(l)ist, (a)dd, (r)emove, or (q)uit: a   

Add to which group : w
Write task:  look busy
```

# (r)emove - removes a task
```
Which group would you like to remove from? c
================================
================================
Tasks in the Code group:
1: Google API
2: Learn COBOL
3: Write an awesome todo app
================================
================================
Write the number of the task you would like to remove: 3


(l)ist, (a)dd, (r)emove, or (q)uit:
```
### 1. type r
### 2. type the beginning letter of group
### 3. type the number of task you don't want

# (q)uit - quits the program. y or n to save your changes
```
(l)ist, (a)dd, (r)emove, or (q)uit: q


Save your list? y or n: y
➜  pydoo git:(master) ✗
```

The repo comes with a pre-populated list with the three groups 
code, work, and home, but you can change those if you want
The main prompt asks you if you want add, remove, list, or quit.  
If you choose add or remove (a or r), the next prompt will ask
for a group. Type either c for code, w for work, or h for home.
Then, for:
add - You type the task in the third prompt
remove - You type the number of the task you want removed.
list - Prints out the current list.
quit - If you want to exit, type q then y for saving, n for not.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
