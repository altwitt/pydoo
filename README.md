# Pydoo

This list application lets you make task list quickly and easily from the command line. When I had a flash of an idea (that I would probably forget), I wanted a lightweight python app that I could put on my Android and quickly type out some things I needed to do. Work great for me!  


## Getting Started

The repo comes with a pre-populated list with the three groups 
code, work, and home, but you can change those if you want
The main prompt asks you if you want add, remove, list, or quit. 
Just type the single characters a, l, r, or q. 
If you choose add or remove (a or r), the next prompt will ask
for a group. Type either c for code, w for work, or h for home.
Then, for:
add - You type the task in the third prompt
remove - You type the number of the task you want removed.
list - Prints out the current list.
quit - If you want to exit, type q then y for saving, n for not.
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
